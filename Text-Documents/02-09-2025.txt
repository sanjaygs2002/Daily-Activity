Profiler:

It is build in react tool to track performance of the react component render and how long it take to be render.
How to use this means 

<Profiler id="myapp" onRender={callbackfunction}>

</Profiler>

And in that callback function we have parameter to track the rendering process they are:
id => it is props for profiler
phase => it is mounting or updating phase during render.
actualDuration => It is time spend in rendering
baseDuration => Time would take without memoization.
startTime => When React started rendering this update.
commitTime => When React finished rendering and committed updates to the DOM.
interactions => used in tracking api's.
