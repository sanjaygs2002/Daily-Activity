Custom Hook:

It is used to create custom logic and share that logic through out when components needs.
To avoid wrapper hell because when use hoc we have wrap multiple components to share data.
And no props drilling.
Custom hooks have atleast one any react hooks inside.


Redux and Flux
Redux:

It is state management library for react and data store at central place when any component to access that data using useSelector and to update the state via useDispatch.
Data flow is [Action => Reducer => Store => View].

Using ToolKit:
createSlice 
It is piece of global state and logic to update it.
reducers, action creators writing separately instead createSlice wrap all in one file.
Insteed of createStore in old redux we use ConfigureStore to hold state.
Combines reducers automatically.
Good default middlewares (redux-thunk, devtools)

Flux:
It is architectural Pattern and unidirectional data flow used to complex state managed for large scale application.
Data Flow: [Action => Dispatcher => store => View].
